Exams Setting Background Recognition
This project could be used to improve upon the existing structures currently being used to proctor exams as E-learning facilities has become common places as the current global pandemic has forced academic institutions to use such E-learning facilities.

Two major challenges this tool addresses are: • Difficult to Manage: The proctor would have to actively attempt to monitor video feeds from several students at the same time, this might become a big challenge once the class population exceeds what he can see in his screen conveniently. • Most video conference facilities allow one to use a virtual background, Hence a student could setup a virtual background to resemble his exam setting and when its time for the exam lecture wont be able to monitor him.

This tool connects directly to the students camera eliminating the possibility of using virtual background and alters the exam proctor once it detects suspicious activity.

Rshiny a tool in R program was used and its html component allows the tool to be easy used remotely with little or no input from the user.
